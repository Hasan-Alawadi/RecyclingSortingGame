# 🗑️ Recycling Game

A fun and interactive web game designed to teach waste sorting while challenging the player to sort different types of waste into appropriate bins. With each level, new waste types are introduced, making it more challenging and educational. The game encourages correct sorting with rewarding animations, progressing difficulty, and a cheerful, friendly design.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

Players start with basic waste types like "Restmüll" (general waste), "Papier" (paper), and "Glas" (glass). As the levels progress, additional categories like "Biomüll" (organic waste), "Buntglas" (colored glass), and "Weißglas" (white glass) are introduced. The goal is to sort the items correctly by moving the item left or right using arrow keys to align it with the right bin. 

When an item is correctly sorted, the bin lid opens with a smiley face 😊, providing immediate feedback and reinforcing learning. Players gain points for each correctly sorted item, and reaching the threshold advances them to the next level with more waste categories. Three incorrect sorts result in a "Game Over" screen, encouraging careful sorting.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Levels**: Each level adds more waste categories, increasing the challenge.
- **Friendly Visuals**: Bin lids open with a smiley face for correct sorting, creating a positive user experience.
- **German Localization**: Bin labels and messages are in German, providing language context for players.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts canvas width dynamically to fit the number of bins for each level.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the game elements like waste items, bins, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Core game logic, animations, and interactions.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for layout and fonts.

## 📝 How to Play
